# Python Clean Packages - Requirements
#
# This project uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required.
#
# The following modules are used (all part of Python standard library):
# - subprocess
# - sys
# - argparse
# - json
# - typing
# - os (indirectly through other modules)
#
# Minimum Python version: 3.8+
#
# If you need to verify your Python version, run:
# python --version
#
# This file is kept minimal to maintain the project's zero-dependency philosophy.
